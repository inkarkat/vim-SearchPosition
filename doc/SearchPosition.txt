DESCRIPTION					  *SearchPosition-description*

The mappings, command and operator provided by this plugin search a range or
the entire buffer for a pattern (defaulting to the last search pattern),
and print a summary of the number of occurrences above, below and on the
current line, e.g.:
    1 match after cursor in this line, 8 following, 2 in previous lines; ~
	total 10 for /\<SearchPosition\>/ ~
    5 matches in this fold, 9 before, 6 following; total 21 for /endif/ ~
    On sole match in this line, 40 in following lines for /let/ ~
    :144,172 7 matches in this fold for /let/ ~

This provides better orientation in a buffer without having to first jump from
search result to search result.

MOTIVATION					   *SearchPosition-motivation*

In its simplest implementation >
    :nnoremap <A-n> :%s///gn<CR>
<   41 matches on 17 lines ~
prints the number of matches for the last search pattern. This plugin
builds on top of this by providing more context with regards to the current
cursor position plus additional information.

This plugin is similar to IndexedSearch.vim (vimscript#1682) by Yakov
Lerner.

==============================================================================
USAGE							*SearchPosition-usage*
							     *:SearchPosition*
:[range]SearchPosition [{pattern}]
			Show position of the search results for {pattern} (or
			the last search pattern (|quote/|) if {pattern} is
			omitted). All lines in [range] (or the entire buffer
			if omitted) are considered, and the number of matches
			in relation to the current cursor position is echoed
			to the command line.
							     *ALT-N* *v_ALT-N*
<Leader><A-n>{motion}	Show position for the last search pattern in the
			lines covered by {motion}.
[count]<A-n>		Show position for the last search pattern in the
			entire buffer, or [count] following lines.
{Visual}<A-n>		Show position for the last search pattern in the
			selected lines.

			The default mapping <A-n> was chosen because one often
			invokes this when jumping to matches via n/N, so <A-n>
			is easy to reach. Imagine 'n' stood for "next
			searches".
							     *ALT-M* *v_ALT-M*
[count]<A-m>		Show position for the whole word under the cursor in
			the entire buffer, or [count] following lines.
			Only whole keywords are searched for, like with the
			|star| command.
[count]g<A-m>		Show position for the word under the cursor in the
			entire buffer, or [count] following lines.
			Also finds contained matches, like |gstar|.

{Visual}<A-m>		Show position for the selected text in the entire
			buffer.

			Imagine 'm' stood for "more occurrences".
			These mappings reuse the last used <cword> when issued
			on a blank line.

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION					 *SearchPosition-installation*

This script is packaged as a |vimball|. If you have the "gunzip" decompressor
in your PATH, simply edit the *.vba.gz package in Vim; otherwise, decompress
the archive first, e.g. using WinZip. Inside Vim, install by sourcing the
vimball or via the |:UseVimball| command. >
    vim SearchPosition.vba.gz
    :so %
To uninstall, use the |:RmVimball| command.

DEPENDENCIES					 *SearchPosition-dependencies*

- Requires Vim 7.0 or higher.

==============================================================================
CONFIGURATION					*SearchPosition-configuration*

For a permanent configuration, put the following commands into your |vimrc|:

					     *g:SearchPosition_HighlightGroup*
The highlight group for the report message can be set via >
    let g:SearchPosition_HighlightGroup = 'ModeMsg'
<
		   *g:SearchPosition_ShowRange* *g:SearchPosition_ShowPattern*
To shorten the report message, the [range] and used search pattern can be
omitted from the message; by default, both are included in the message text: >
    let g:SearchPosition_ShowRange = 1
    let g:SearchPosition_ShowPattern = 1
<

If you want to use different mappings, map your keys to the
<Plug>SearchPosition* mapping targets _before_ sourcing the script (e.g. in
your |vimrc|): >
    nmap <Leader>,n <Plug>SearchPositionOperator
    nmap <Leader>n <Plug>SearchPositionCurrent
    vmap <Leader>n <Plug>SearchPositionCurrent
    nmap <Leader>m <Plug>SearchPositionWholeCword
    vmap <Leader>m <Plug>SearchPositionCword
    nmap <Leader>M <Plug>SearchPositionCword

==============================================================================
LIMITATIONS					  *SearchPosition-limitations*

- The summary always includes full lines, even if {motion} or the visual
  selection cover only parts of lines.

HISTORY						      *SearchPosition-history*

1.15	30-Sep-2011
- Use <silent> for <Plug> mapping instead of default mapping.

1.14	12-Sep-2011
- Reuse: Use ingointegration#GetVisualSelection() instead of inline capture.

1.13	08-Oct-2010
- BUG: The previous fix for the incorrect reporting of sole match in folded
  line was susceptible to non-local matches when current line is the first
  line.

1.12	08-Oct-2010
- BUG: Visual mode <A-m> /Plug>SearchPositionCword mapping on multi-line
  selection searched for ^@, not the newline character \n.
- BUG: Incorrect reporting of sole match in folded line when the current line
  is empty and the pattern starts matching a newline character.
- Using SearchPosition#SavePosition() instead ofVim version-dependent) mark to
  keep the cursor at the position where the operator was invokedonly necessary
  with a backward {motion}).

1.11	02-Jun-2010
Appended "; total N" to evaluations that excluded the match on the cursor from
the "overall" count, as it was misleading what "overall" meant in this
context.

1.10	08-Jan-2010
- Moved functions from plugin to separate autoload script.
- BUG: Wrong reporting of additional occurrences when the current line is
  outside the passed range.
- BUG: Catch non-existing items in evaluations that can be caused by e.g.
  having \%# inside the search pattern. Warn about "special atoms have
  distorted the tally" in such cases.

1.03	05-Jan-2010
ENH: Offering a whole-word ALT-M mapping in addition to the former literal
search (which is now mapped to g_ALT-M), like the |star| and |gstar| commands.

1.02	11-Sep-2009
BUG: Cannot set mark " in Vim 7.0 and 7.1; using mark z instead. This only
affected the <Leader><A-n>{motion} command.

1.01	19-Jun-2009
The jumplist is not clobbered anymore by the :SearchPosition command.

1.00	15-May-2009
First published version.

0.01	07-Aug-2008
Started development.
